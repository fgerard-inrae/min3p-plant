! Default number of threads: 1
! Required if you want to use more than 1 threads.

! Parallel arguments.
! If the program runs as openmp parallel version,
! the argements are similar as 
! "-numofthreads_global 8 -output_runtime -input_file"
! If the program runs as MPI parallel version,
! please change "MIN3P EXECUTABLE PROGRAM PATH" to the mpiexec path
! and the arguments are similar as
! "-n 8 path\min3p_thcm.exe -output_runtime -input_file"
!PARALLEL ARGUMENTS

! Specify destination folder (MIN3P simulation result folder)
! This folder contains all the examples that need to be run by MIN3P.
! Required in both MIN3P simulation and result compare.
! Please do NOT include the last slash (\) (NOT: .\..\Dest\)

!!!       The following commands are used in result compare        !!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

! Run MIN3P simulation compare.
! Comment out the following command if result compare is not necessary.
! Required if you want to run result compare.
RUN RESULT COMPARE

! Specify the source folder (Referenced result folder)
! This folder contains all the refenenced examples and results.
! Required only if you need to run result compare.
! Please do NOT include the last slash (\).
SOURCE FOLDER

! Specify the folder to store the result compare difference.
! The exist files in this folder will be replaced, but not deleted.
! This folder will be created by program if not exist.
! Required only if you need to run result compare.
RESULT COMPARE STORE DIFFERENCE FOLDER
.\..\Diff_Benchmarks_V2.6.Temp_vs_V2.5.1.875

! Specify if you need to export the detail difference report.
! By default, result compare only export the difference summary,
! Indicating which file is changed.
EXPORT RESULT DIFFERENCE DETAIL REPORT

! Specify if you need to ignore the missing files in
! destination folder (MIN3P simulation result folder),
! by default, the missing files are considered in result compare.
! Required only if you need to run result compare.
! IGNORE MISSING FILES IN RESULT FOLDER

! Specify if you need to ignore the missing files in
! Referenced result folder (Source folder),
! by default, the missing files are considered in result compare.
! Required only if you need to run result compare.
! IGNORE MISSING FILES IN REFERENCED RESULT FOLDER

! Specify the ignored files in result compare.
! Start with the number of ignored file extension names, 
! and followed by extension names.

! Mix value text compare is smarter than text compare
! e.g., "0.2648112-313" and "0.0000000E+00" are treated the same as value compare.
! e.g., "siderite(d)        0.000        3.4900E-04" and 
! "siderite(d)       -0.000        3.4900E-04" are treated the same
! Note: space is the separator of values and it is ignored in comparison.
! Mix value text compare is more time consuming
MIX VALUE TEXT COMPARE TOLERANCE
1.0E-100

! Mix value text compare is smarter than text compare
! e.g., "1.234567e-20" and "1.234566e-20" are treated the same as value compare 
! as relative error is 0.000001e-20/1.234567e-20 < 1.0e-5
! Note: space is the separator of values and it is ignored in comparison.
! Mix value text compare is more time consuming
MIX VALUE TEXT COMPARE RELATIVE TOLERANCE
1.0E-5

! Set global best match compare mode, this allow the comparison in different lines.
! By default, the program will use same line to line compare mode, this allow the 
! comparison in the same lines. Please note that global best match compare is much 
! more time consumer especially for the large files with bad-match lines.
! It is suggested to use same line to line compare mode.
! e.g., (required if use this), GLOBAL BEST MATCH COMPARE MODE
! e.g., (not required is use this), SAME LINE COMPARE MODE
! GLOBAL BEST MATCH COMPARE MODE

! Set the difference collection mode. By default, the program will collect all the
! differences. For large files with millions of difference, this will take a long time
! especially when mix value text compare is invoked. 
! It is suggested to collect the first 100 differences.
! The following commands collect all the firtst n difference. 
! If n = 0, it will collect all the difference.
! e.g., DIFFERENCE COLLECTION MODE 
!       n
DIFFERENCE COLLECTION MODE
