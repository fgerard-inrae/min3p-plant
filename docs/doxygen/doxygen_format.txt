For Fortran "!>" or "!<" starts a comment and "!!" or "!>" can be used to continuate a one line comment into a multi-line comment.
Here is an example of a documented Fortran subroutine: 
  !> Build the restriction matrix for the aggregation 
  !! method.
  !! @param aggr information about the aggregates
  !! @todo Handle special case
  subroutine IntRestBuild(A,aggr,Restrict,A_ghost)
    implicit none
    Type(SpMtx), intent(in) :: A !< our fine level matrix
    Type(Aggrs), intent(in) :: aggr
    Type(SpMtx), intent(out) :: Restrict !< Our restriction matrix
