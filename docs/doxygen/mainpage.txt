 * @section INTRODUCTION
 *
 * The MIN3P_THCm code is developed as a multicomponent reactive transport model 
 * for variably saturated porous media in one, two or three spatial dimensions 
 * with the extension of heat transport, one dimensional hydromechanical coupling, 
 * multicomponent diffusion and reactive transport in highly saline solution. 
 * Advective-dispersive transport in the aqueous phase, as well as diffusive gas 
 * transport can be considered. Darcy velocities are calculated internally using 
 * a variably-saturated flow module. The model formulation is based on the global 
 * implicit solution approach, which considers reaction and transport processes 
 * simultaneously. This formulation enforces a global mass balance between solid, 
 * surface, dissolved and gaseous species and thus facilitates the investigation 
 * of the interactions of reaction and transport processes. The model can also
 * be used as a batch model for equilibrium speciation problems, kinetic batch 
 * problems or for the generation of pC-pH-diagrams.
 * <br/> <br/>
 * MIN3P-THCm is characterized by a high degree of flexibility with respect to the
 * definition of the geochemical reaction network to facilitate the application of 
 * the model to a wide range of hydrogeological and geochemical problems. Chemical 
 * processes included are homogeneous reactions in the aqueous phase, such as 
 * complexation and oxidation-reduction reactions, as well as heterogeneous reactions, 
 * such as ion exchange, surface complexation, mineral dissolution-precipitation and 
 * gas exchange reactions. Reactions within the aqueous phase and dissolution-precipitation 
 * reactions can be considered as equilibrium or kinetically-controlled processes.
 * <br/> <br/>
 * A new, general framework for kinetically-controlled intra-aqueous and mineral
 * dissolution-precipitation reactions was developed. All kinetically-controlled reactions 
 * can be described as reversible or irreversible reaction processes. Different reaction
 * mechanisms for dissolution-precipitation reactions are considered, which can be
 * subdivided into surface- and transport-controlled reactions. This approach allows the
 * consideration of a large number of rate expressions reported in the literature. Related
 * reaction and rate parameters can be incorporated into the model through an
 * accompanying database. The model is primarily designed for problems involving
 * inorganic chemistry, but reactions involving organic chemicals can also be
 * accommodated. Microbially-mediated reactions can be described using a multiplicative
 * Monod approach.
