Usage: SubWCRev WorkingCopyPath [SrcVersionFile DstVersionFile] [-nmdf]

Params:
WorkingCopyPath    :   path to a Subversion working copy.
SrcVersionFile     :   path to a template file containing keywords.
DstVersionFile     :   path to save the resulting parsed file.
-n                 :   if given, then SubWCRev will error if the working
                       copy contains local modifications.
-m                 :   if given, then SubWCRev will error if the working
                       copy contains mixed revisions.
-d                 :   if given, then SubWCRev will only do its job if
                       DstVersionFile does not exist.

-f                 :   if given, then SubWCRev will include the
                       last-committed revision of folders. Default is
                       to use only files to get the revision numbers.
                       this only affects $WCREV$ and $WCDATE$.
-e                 :   if given, also include dirs which are included
                       with svn:externals, but only if they're from the
                       same repository.

-x                 :   if given, then SubWCRev will write the revisions
                       numbers in HEX instead of decimal
-X                 :   if given, then SubWCRev will write the revisions
                       numbers in HEX with '0x' before them

Switches must be given in a single argument, e.g. '-nm' not '-n -m'.

SubWCRev reads the Subversion status of all files in a working copy
excluding externals. If SrcVersionFile is specified, it is scanned
for special placeholders of the form "$WCxxx$".
SrcVersionFile is then copied to DstVersionFile but the placeholders
are replaced with information about the working copy as follows:

$WCREV$         Highest committed revision number
$WCDATE$        Date of highest committed revision
$WCDATE=$       Like $WCDATE$ with an added strftime format after the =
$WCRANGE$       Update revision range
$WCURL$         Repository URL of the working copy
$WCNOW$         Current system date & time
$WCNOW=$        Like $WCNOW$ with an added strftime format after the =
$WCLOCKDATE$    Lock date for this item
$WCLOCKDATE=$   Like $WCLOCKDATE$ with an added strftime format after the =
$WCLOCKOWNER$   Lock owner for this item
$WCLOCKCOMMENT$ Lock comment for this item


The strftime format strings for $WCxxx=$ must not be longer than 1024
characters, and must not produce output greater than 1024 characters.

Placeholders of the form "$WCxxx?TrueText:FalseText$" are replaced with
TrueText if the tested condition is true, and FalseText if false.

$WCMODS$        True if local modifications found
$WCMIXED$       True if mixed update revisions found
$WCINSVN$       True if the item is versioned
$WCNEEDSLOCK$   True if the svn:needs-lock property is set
$WCISLOCKED$    True if the item is locked
