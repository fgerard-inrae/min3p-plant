# MIN3P
MIN3P open source version based on MIN3P V2.6.2.880.

MIN3P is a general purpose flow and reactive transport code for variably saturated media providing a high degree of flexibility with respect to the definition of the reaction network. Advective-diffusive transport in the water phase and diffusive transport in the gas phase are included.  Equilibrium reactions considered are aqueous complexation, gas partitioning between phases, oxidation-reduction, ion exchange, and surface complexation. The reaction network is designed to handle kinetically controlled intra-aqueous and dissolution-precipitation reactions, and the dissolution of non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs). All reactions can be defined through a database, not requiring external code generation by the user.

For Windows user, please go to src/project/visualstudio for sequential version and src/project/visualstudio_omp for OpenMP parallel version.

For Linux/Unix or CYGWIN user, please go to src/project/makefile for sequential version, src/project/makefile_omp for OpenMP parallel version, src/project/makefile_p for MPI parallel version and src/project/makefile_hybrid for hybrid MPI-OpenMP parallel version.
